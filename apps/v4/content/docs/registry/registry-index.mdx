title: Add a Registry
description: Open Source Registry Index
---

The open source registry index is a list of all the open source registries that are available to use out of the box.

When you run `shadcn add` or `shadcn search`, the CLI will automatically check the registry index for the registry you are looking for and add it to your `components.json` file.

You can see the full list at [https://ui.shadcn.com/r/registries.json](https://ui.shadcn.com/r/registries.json).

## Adding a Registry

You can open an issue to add a registry to the index by filling out the [registry directory issue template](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/new?template=registry_directory.yml).

Once you have submitted your issue, it will be validated and reviewed by the team.

### Requirements

1. The registry must be open source and publicly accessible.
2. The registry must be a valid JSON file that conforms to the [registry schema specification](/docs/registry/registry-json).
3. The registry is expected to be a flat registry with no nested items i.e `/registry.json` and `/component-name.json` files are expected to be in the root of the registry.
4. The `files` array, if present, must NOT include a `content` property.

Here's an example of a valid registry:

```json title="registry.json" showLineNumbers
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema/registry.json",
  "name": "acme",
  "homepage": "https://acme.com",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "login-form",
      "type": "registry:component",
      "title": "Login Form",
      "description": "A login form component.",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "registry/new-york/auth/login-form.tsx",
          "type": "registry:component"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "example-login-form",
      "type": "registry:component",
      "title": "Example Login Form",
      "description": "An example showing how to use the login form component.",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "registry/new-york/examples/example-login-form.tsx",
          "type": "registry:component"
        }
      ]
    }
    }
  ]
}
```
